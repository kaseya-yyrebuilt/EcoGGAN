# EcoGGAN

## Introduction
This project implemented a signal processing and GAN model for synthesizing artificial ECoG data

## Code Structure
```
- data/

  Raw ECoG dataset for training and signal processing

- logs/

  Saves for synthetic ECoG data generated by GAN for each epoch

- models:

  Different types of GAN for experimental purposes. (*) means for future implementation
  - WGAN with GP
  - DCGAN (*)
  - VAE (*)
  
- nets

  Saved networks
  
- preprocess.py
  
  Preprosessing for ECoG signals
  
- get_config.py
  
  Configuration file
  
- get_dataloader
  
  Dataloader for the network

- ecog_wgp_train
  
  Training for WGAN with gradient penalty
```
